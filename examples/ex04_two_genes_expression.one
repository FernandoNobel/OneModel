### How to model the expression of two proteins. ###

# Import ProteinConstitutive model.
# (note that the standalone code is not imported).
from ex03_protein_constitutive import ProteinConstitutive

# Initialize A and B as instances of ProteinConstitutive.
A = ProteinConstitutive()  
B = ProteinConstitutive()

# We could easily add more proteins by writing:
# C = ProteinConstitutive()
# ...
