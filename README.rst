OneModel
========

**OneModel** is a Python package for defining dynamic synthetic biology models in an easy and effective way.
OneModel syntax allows the definition of models with chemical reactions, ODEs and/or algebraic loops --this makes OneModel suitable for control therory approach.

to define and export synthetic biology DAE models. OneModel enables you to define synthetic biology mathematical models in a simple coding syntax (OneModel syntax) and allows you to export your model into an implementation for other programming/simulation laguages (i.e. Matlab, Julia, OpenModelica, etc).
