Quick Start

Usage
-----

OneModel has two main interfaces: *onemodel-cli* (a command-line interface) and *onemodel-gui* (a graphical user interface). 

*onemodel-cli* implements all OneModel commands and functionality.
It is a good choice for advanced users which are used to working in the terminal as it can be integrated easily in other tools or workflows.

*onemodel-gui* is an user-friendly desktop application which executes *onemodel-gui* in the background, this way the user can access all OneModel functionally without dealing with *onemodel-cli* commands.
It is most suitable for the average user.
